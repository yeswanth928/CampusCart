# Campus Cart

This is an E-Commerce Application Customer-to-Customer platform.
And one thing that sets this apart from rest of the mobile applications would be that this app is that the idea, as it is useful and we don't have popular apps that offer this required service. This app is not meant for everyone, this is specially being developed for **students**.

## Introduction

This is an E-Commerce type application specificaly developed for students.

Students can post what they are willing to sell using the app.
And students can also search for what they want. and the results will feature only the products that are for sale from the same college students.

This can be very useful because many students would like to sell books or products of the previous semesters that they don't use. At the same time studets will search for used books as they are cheap and some of the books will be used for only a semester. And this application can connect these students. There is no need for a third person like a delivery person as the students can contact each other and meet as they belong to same campus.

## Technologies being used

**Flutter** is used for development of Android application.

**Firebase** is used for backend and also for authentication.

**Firestore** is used as database and **Firebase Storage** is used for storing images.

**Firebase Dynamic Links** for deeplinks.
